## 1.0.2

Ok, maybe NOW the disconnect handling is correct?

## 1.0.1

Fixed a few unawaited futures

## 1.0.0

Added autoping, and I think I made disconnection detection more robust, so, 1.0.0 now

## 0.9.1

Fixed some bugs in the examples; I think they all work, now

## 0.9.0

Most of it works - I think raw sockets may not work, and I'm working out some bugginess possibly relating to Android.
